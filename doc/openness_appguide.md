## Introduction
OpenNESS is an open source software toolkit to enable easy orchestration of edge services across diverse network platform and access technologies in multi-cloud environments. It is inspired by the edge computing architecture defined by the ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing standards (e.g., [ETSI_MEC 003]), as well as the 5G network architecture ([3GPP_23501]).
 
It leverages major industry edge orchestration frameworks, such as Kubernetes and OpenStack, to implement a cloud-native architecture that is multi-platform, multi-access, and multi-cloud. It goes beyond these frameworks, however, by providing the ability for applications to publish their presence and capabilities on the platform, and for other applications to subscribe to those services. Services may be very diverse, from providing location and radio network information, to operating a computer vision system that recognize pedestrians and cars, and forwards metadata from those objects to to downstream traffic safety applications.
 
OpenNESS is access network agnostic, as it provides an architecture that interoperates with LTE, 5G, WiFi, and wired networks. In edge computing, dataplane flows must be routed to edge nodes with regard to physical location (e.g., proximity to the endpoint, system load on the edge node, special hardware requirements). OpenNESS provides APIs that allow network orchestrators and edge computing controllers to configure routing policies in a uniform manner.
 
This guide is targeted at the <b><i>Cloud Application developers</b></i>: 
- Who would like develop applications for Edge compute taking advantages of all the capabilities exposed through Edge Compute APIs in OpenNESS. 
- Who would like to port the existing applications and services in the public/private cloud to edge unmodified. 

The document will describe how to go about developing applications from scratch using the template/example applications/services provided in the OpenNESS software release. All the OpenNESS Applications and services can be found in the [edgeapps repo](https://github.com/open-ness/edgeapps). 

## OpenNESS Edge Node Applications
OpenNESS Applications can onboarded and provisioned on the edge node only through OpenNESS Controller. The first step in Onboarding involves uploading the application image to the controller through the web interface. Both VM and Container images are supported. 

OpenNESS application can be categorised in different ways depending on the scenarios. 

- Depending on the OpenNESS APIs support 
  - Applications calling EAA APIs for providing or consuming service on the edge compute along with servicing end-users traffic 
  - Applications not availing any services on the edge compute just servicing end-user traffic 

- Depending on the Application Execution platform 
  - Application running natively on Edge node in a VM/Container provisioned by the OpenNESS controller 
  - Application running on Local breakout not provisioned by the OpenNESS controller 

- Depending on the servicing the end-user traffic
  - Producer Application
  - Consumer Application 

### <b>Producer Application</b>
OpenNESS Producer application are edge compute application that provide services to other applications running on the edge compute platform. Producer applications do not serve end users traffic directly. They are sometime also referred to as Edge services. Here are some of the characteristics of a producer app.
- It is mandatory for all producer apps to authenticate and acquire TLS 
- All producer apps need to activate if the service provided by them needs to be discoverable by other edge applications 
- A producer application can have one or more fields for which it will provide notification update 

### <b>Consumer Application</b>
OpenNESS Consumer application are edge compute application that serve end users traffic directly. Consumer applications might or might not subscribe to the services from other producer applications on the edge node. Here are some of the characteristics of a consumer app.
- It is not mandatory for consumer apps to authenticate if they don't wish to call EAA APIs.  
- A consumer application can subscribe to any number of services from producer apps. Future extension can implement entitlements to consumer apps to create access control lists. 
- Producer to Consumer update will use web socket for notification. If there is further data to be shared between producer and consumer other NFVi components like OVS/VPP/NIC-VF can be used for data transfer. 

### Example of Producer and Consumer Applications
The OpenNESS release includes reference producer and consumer applications.

The consumer application is based on OpenVINO [OpenVINO] (https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit)

- OpenVINO consumer app executes inference on input video stream
- OpenVINO producer app generates notifications to the consumer app for changing the inference model
- Video input stream is captured from a webcam installed on an Embedded Linux client device
- The annotated video is streamed out of the OpenNESS edge node back to the client device for further data analysis

### <b> Cloud Adapter Edge compute Application </b>
All the major Cloud Service providers are implementing frameworks to deploy edge applications that link back to their cloud via connectors. For example, Amazon Greengrass enables lambda functions to be deployed on the edge and connecting to the AWS cloud using the GreenGrass service. While it was originally intended to host this type of edge software on IoT gateways, the same framework can be utilized by Service Providers and Enterprises, to implement a multi-cloud strategy for their Edge Nodes.  

OpenNESS enables this approach by running the Greengrass Core (with the Edge software) as Edge applications on the Edge Node. They can run unchanged, or modified to utilize the EAA APIs to serve as Producer or Consumer apps on the edge Node. By running multiple cloud connector instances from different cloud service providers on the same edge node, a multi-cloud experience can be easily implemented. 

OpenNESS supports this by ability to deploy public cloud IOT gateways from cloud vendors like Amazon AWS IoT Greengrass and Baidu OpenEdge on edge compute platform. The existing IOT gateways can be migrated to OpenNESS as is or enhanced to call EAA APIs using extensions like Lambda functions.
