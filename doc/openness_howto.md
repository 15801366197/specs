## Introduction
The aim of this guide is to familiarize the user with OpenNESS controller's User Interface. This "How to" guide will provide instructions on how to create a sample configuration via UI.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Controller and Edge node installation and configuration is assumed to be run as `root`. 
2. Controller Web UI only supports only one user and its `admin` user.   
3. As part of the Application deployment a HTTPs based Application Image download server is required. 
    - An example is provided in the "Creating HTTPS server for image download" section to deploy HTTPs image server on Controller.    
   
  ![HTTPs Image Server setup](howto-images/openness_apponboard.png)

#### Creating HTTPS server for image download
##### Instructions to setup HTTP server 
Prerequisites:
- Controller should be up and running in order to access root CA. 

- Install apache and mod_ssl     
`yum install -y httpd mod_ssl`    
- Go into /etc/ssl/certs    
 `cd /etc/ssl/certs`    
- Acquire the controller root ca and key
```
docker cp edgecontroller_cce_1:/artifacts/certificates/ca/cert.pem . 
docker cp edgecontroller_cce_1:/artifacts/certificates/ca/key.pem .
``` 
- Generate the apache key and crt
```
openssl genrsa -out apache.key 2048
openssl req -new -sha256 -key apache.key -subj "/C=IE/ST=Clare/O=ESIE/CN=$(hostname -f)" -out apache.csr
openssl x509 -req -in apache.csr -CA cert.pem -CAkey key.pem -CAcreateserial -out apache.crt -days 500 -sha256
```
- Edit apache config and point it to the new certs
```
sed -i 's|^SSLCertificateFile.*$|SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/apache.crt|g' /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
sed -i 's|^SSLCertificateKeyFile.*$|SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/certs/apache.key|g' /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```
- Set the firewall to accept the traffic
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --reload    
``` 
- Enable and restart apache after the changes
```
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl restart httpd
```

##### Instruction to upload and access images
> Note: Refer to "Docker Images Creation" in the "OpenVINO Sample Application in OpenNESS - README.md file" under <edge_node>/build/openvino. 

- Put the images into /var/www/html    
`cp test_image.tar.gz /var/www/html/`    
`chmod a+r /var/www/html/*tar.gz`    
- Construct the URL (Source in Controller UI) as:    
`https://<controller_hostname>/test_image.tar.gz`

>Note: Controller host name to be used for the URL can be acquired by running ```hostname -f``` in the controller node shell. 

### First login
In order to access the UI the user needs to provide credentials during login.

Prerequisites:
- An internet browser to access the login page.
- REACT_APP_CONTROLLER_API='http://<Controller_IP_address>:8080' added to Controller's "~/edgecontroller/ui/controller/.env" file.
- If working behind proxy or firewall appropriate ports open.
- Controller set up (including the UI application) and running.

The following steps need to be done for successful login:
- Open internet browser.
- Type in http://<Controller_ip_address>:3000/login in address bar.
- Enter you username and password (default username: admin) (the password to be used is the password provided during Controller bring-up with the CCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD in "~/edgecontroller/ui/controller/.env").
- Click on "SIGN IN" button.

![Login screen](howto-images/login.png)

### Enrollment

In order for the Controller and Edge Node to work together the Edge Node needs to enroll with the Controller. The Edge Node will continuously try to connect to the controller until its serial key is recognized by the Controller.

Prerequisites:
- Controller's IP address must be provided in Edge Node's "scripts/ansible/deploy_server/vars/defaults.yml" file. This IP needs to be added/edited in the file in following format: enrollment_endpoint: "<Controller_IP_address>:8081"
- Controller's ROOT CA  needs to be added to "/etc/pki/tls/certs/controller-root-ca.pem" on Edge Node. The certificate can be aquired by running `docker cp edgecontroller_cce_1:/artifacts/certificates/ca/cert.pem . `.
- The Edge Node's deployment script has been started ('./03_build_and_deploy.sh' script on Edge Node is printing out "Waiting for certificates").
- Upon Edge Node's deployment a Serial Key has been printed out to the terminal and retrieved to be used during enrollment.
- User has logged in to UI.

In order to enroll and add new Edge Node to be managed by the Controller the following steps are to be taken:
- Navigate to 'NODES' tab.
- Click on 'ADD EDGE NODE' button.

![DNS](howto-images/DNS.png)

 ### 7 OpenVINO Manual Configuration steps

The following manual steps need to be done to fully configure the OpenVino pipeline on the EdgeNode. These steps need to be run from terminal on the EdgeNode.

Run 'docker ps' to find running containers on EdgeNode.
OpenVino consumer container can be distinguished by "./start.sh" text in its 'COMMAND' field under 'docker ps'.

Configure DNS container's KNI interface:
 
```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> ip link set dev vEth0 arp off
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> ip a a 53.53.53.53/24 dev vEth0
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> ip link set dev vEth0 up
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> ip route add 192.168.200.0/24 dev vEth0
```

Make a request on the DNS interface subnet to register the KNI interface with NTS client (press CTRL + C buttons as soon as a request is made (no expectation for hostname to resolve)):

```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> wget 192.168.200.123 -Y off
```

Configure OpenVino Consumer container's KNI interface:
Find the name of KNI interface inside the container (interface name vEthX):
```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  ip addr
```
Using the found interface name run following:

```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  ip link set dev vEth2 arp off
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  ip a a 192.168.200.20/24 dev vEth2
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  ip link set dev vEth2 up
```

Make a request on the OpenVino Consumer interface subnet to register the KNI interface with NTS client (press CTRL + C buttons as soon as a request is made (no expectation for hostname to resolve)):
```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  wget 192.168.200.123 -Y off
```

### 8 OpenVINO Downstream setup 

This is a sample setup for Downstream setup (EPC/IP Downstream). This is downstream node in this example will behave like Application connected to the PDN gateway or IP gateway. For the purpose of testing OpenVINO App in the IP domain. You need to connect a server and assign an IP to an interface connected to the Edge Node Downstream. The IP assigned IP address must be as follows - 192.168.200.2. 

> Note: Do not Ping/send traffic from downstream to the Application on the edge node. This is because ping/sending traffic will add a learning entry into the NTS dataplane. If this is done by mistake then NTS Dataplane has to be restarted and the Traffic policy needs to be re-configured. 

### 9 OpenVINO Client Simulator Setup

The following prerequisites must be installed on the platform where the client
simulator will be set up:

* Docker
* OS with graphical support
* VNC server or a physically attached monitor

1. Update `/etc/hosts` file with a record for `openvino.openness` hostname

    ```shell
    echo "192.168.200.20 openvino.openness" >> /etc/hosts
    ```

2. Set the IP address of the ethernet interface which is connected to the
OpenNESS Edge Node with an IP address in the same subnet as for
`openvino.openness` hostname

    ```shell
    ifconfig enp1s0f0 192.168.200.10 up
    ```

3. In order for the NTS Dataplane to have learnt both upstream and downstream traffic flow we need to send traffic (Ping/iperf) from Upstream IP to the downstream server.    
  
   ```shell
    ping 192.168.200.2
   ```

3. Update ARP tables for the configured interface

    ```shell
    arp -s openvino.openness deadbeef
    ```

## Kubernetes Install hints
For the Kubernetes setup OpenNESS controller is assumed to be running on the same platform as Kubernetes master. 

### Disable SE Linux & swap
Depending on the deployment setup you might have to disable selinux and swap. 
```
swapoff -a
setenforce 0
sed -i 's/^SELINUX=enforcing$/SELINUX=permissive/' /etc/selinux/config
```

### Install Kubernetes
Typical commands and steps for installing Kubernetes packages 

```
cat <<EOF > /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
[kubernetes]
name=Kubernetes
baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/kubernetes-el7-x86_64
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg
exclude=kube*
EOF
 
yum install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl --disableexcludes=kubernetes
```

### Firewall: iptables configuration for ipv6
Depending on the deployment setup below are some of the steps to consider for iptables configuration for ipv6. 
```
cat <<EOF >  /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
EOF
 
sysctl --system
```
### lan variable configuration 
/etc/rc.d/rc.local
Add following lines, customize lan variable. Update the IP address according your deployment 
```
swapoff -a
setenforce 0
 
printf -v pool '%s,' 10.244.0.{1..253}
printf -v service '%s,' 10.96.0.{1..253}
printf -v lan '%s,' 10.103.104.{1..253}
export no_proxy="${lan%,},${service%,},${pool%,},127.0.0.1"
```
Enable rc-local
```
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local
systemctl enable rc-local.service
```

### Proxy setting 
Depending on the deployment setup below are some of the steps to consider for proxy configuration in `/etc/profile.d/proxy.sh`. Update the IP address according your deployment 

```
#!/bin/bash
 
printf -v lan '%s,' 10.103.104.{1..253}
 
http_proxy=http://<proxy>:<port>
https_proxy=http://<proxy>:<port>
ftp_proxy=http://<proxy>:<port>
no_proxy="localhost,127.0.0.1,${lan%,}"
 
HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy>:<port>
HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy>:<port>
FTP_PROXY=http://<proxy>:<port>
NO_PROXY="localhost,127.0.0.1,${lan%,}"
```

### Kubernetes master: Install docker & docker-compose
Steps applicable only for controller node. Docker on edge node is installed by ansible. 
```
yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2 python-pip
yum-config-manager  --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
yum install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
pip install docker-compose
systemctl enable docker --now
```

Run k8s' kubelet
```
systemctl enable kubelet --now
```

Proxy setup
Customize HTTP(S)_PROXY and local-network/mask in `/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf`. Update the IP address according your deployment 
```
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy>:<port>/" "HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy>:<port>/" "NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1,10.244.0.0/16,10.96.0.0/24,local-network/mask"
```

Add Environment lines under `[Service]` in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service`. Update the IP address according your deployment.
```
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy>:<port>"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://<proxy>:<port>"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,10.244.0.0/16,10.96.0.0/24,local-network/mask"
```
and in `/usr/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf` 
```
[Service]
Environment="KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=--runtime-cgroups=/systemd/system.slice --kubelet-cgroups=/systemd/system.slice --feature-gates=\"HugePages=true\""     
```
and in  `~/.docker/config.json`
```
{
  "proxies":
  {
    "default":
    {
      "httpProxy": "http://<proxy>:<port>",
      "httpsProxy": "http://<proxy>:<port>",
      "noProxy": "localhost,<HOST_IP>"
    }
  }
}
``` 
### Restart services
```
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart docker && systemctl restart kubelet
```
### Firewall configuration on Kubernetes master 

```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=6443/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=2379-2380/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=10250-10252/tcp
firewall-cmd  --reload
``` 

### Firewall configuration on the Edge node 
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=10250/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=30000-32767/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8285/udp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=8472/udp
firewall-cmd  --reload
```
### Logout & Login to reload proxy

## Edge Controller K8s master Configuration hints]

### K8s master - Initialize master
Update the IP address according your deployment 
```
kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```
Note the output - the "kubeadm join" command

Copy config
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
cp -f /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
``` 
Enable flannel network plugin
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coreos/flannel/62e44c867a2846fefb68bd5f178daf4da3095ccb/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```
Wait couple minutes & check if k8s master works - should be STATUS=Ready.
```
kubectl get nodes
```

### Controller
Set up according to OpenNESS controller README.

Edit controller-ce/.env file
```
REACT_APP_CONTROLLER_API=http://<HOST_IP>:8080
CCE_ORCHESTRATION_MODE=kubernetes
CCE_K8S_MASTER_HOST=localhost:6443
CCE_K8S_MASTER_USER=root
CCE_K8S_API_PATH=/api/v1
CCE_K8S_CLIENT_CA_PATH=...
CCE_K8S_CLIENT_CERT_PATH=...
CCE_K8S_CLIENT_KEY_PATH=...
GITHUB_TOKEN=...
``` 
> Note: Github token is not needed if you are using offline installer. 
Or run cce directly:
```
go build -o dist/cce ./cmd/cce
 
http_proxy= https_proxy= HTTP_PROXY= HTTPS_PROXY= ./dist/cce \
    -dsn "root:changeme@tcp(:8083)/controller_ce" \
    -adminPass changeme \
    -httpPort 8080 -grpcPort 8081 \
    -elaPort 42101 -evaPort 42102 \
    -orchestration-mode kubernetes \
    -k8s-client-ca-path /PATH/TO/CA.CRT \
    -k8s-client-cert-path /PATH/TO/CLIENT-CERT.CRT \
    -k8s-client-key-path /PATH/TO/CLIENT-KEY.KEY \
    -k8s-master-host localhost:6443 \
    -k8s-api-path /api/v1 \
    -k8s-master-user root
``` 

## Edge Node Configuration hints

### Edge Node set up
Set up according to OpenNESS Edge node README 

Before `./03_build_and_deploy.sh`    
- Edit `/etc/pki/tls/certs/controller-root-ca.pem`    
- Edit `/root/appliance-ce/scripts/ansible/deploy_server/vars/defaults.yml`    
```
enrollment_endpoint: "1.2.3.4:8081" => "10.103.104.156:8081"
``` 
- Edit `/root/appliance-ce/configs/eva.json`
```
kubernetesMode": false => true
```

### Perform node's enrollment

### Set up k8s worker - use the instruction above

Join the cluster using command from kubeadm init's output    
example: 
```
kubeadm join 10.103.104.156:6443 --token <token> \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<token>
```

### Set up dnsmasq
First - disable libvirt's DNS. In file /usr/share/libvirt/networks/default.xml replace:
```
<dns>
  <host ip="192.168.122.1">
    <hostname>eaa.community.appliance.mec</hostname>
  </host>
  <host ip="192.168.122.1">
    <hostname>syslog.community.appliance.mec</hostname>
  </host>
</dns>
```
with
```
<dns enable="no"/>
```

Run commands in order to redefine network:

```
virsh net-destroy default
virsh net-undefine default
virsh net-define /usr/share/libvirt/networks/default.xml
virsh net-start default
virsh net-autostart default
```

Change dnsmasq config (/etc/dnsmasq.conf):

```
strict-order
except-interface=lo
address=/eaa.community.appliance.mec/syslog.community.appliance.mec/192.168.122.1
```

Start dnsmasq service:
```systemctl enable dnsmasq --now```

Provide kubelet with new DNS address
Edit `/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml` and change IP under 'clusterDNS' to 192.168.122.1, i.e.:
```
clusterDNS:
- 192.168.122.1
```

Add rules to firewall
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -d 192.168.122.1 -p tcp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -d 192.168.122.1 -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 nat POSTROUTING 0 -s 10.244.0.0/16 -d 192.168.122.0/24 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --reload
```
Reboot edge node
After reboot, edge node container must be started

```
docker container ls -a | grep appliance
docker container start <ID>
```

### (master) Label worker and check status    
Label worker    

After joining worker to cluster, worker needs to be labeled.

k8s_worker_node is a name of node

edge_node_uuid is a UUID of node generated by Controller during enrollment
```
kubectl label node <k8s_worker_node> node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker
kubectl label nodes <k8s_worker_node> node-id=<edge_node_uuid>
``` 
### Check status of nodes

Getting worker node ready can take couple of minutes
```
kubectl get nodes
```

## CUPS UI usage
### CUPS UI Prerequisites
- Controller installation, configuration and run as root. Before build, need to setup controller env file for CUPS as below:
  
  ```
  REACT_APP_CONTROLLER_API=http://<controller_ip_address>>:8080
  REACT_APP_CUPS_API=http://<<oamagent_ip_address>>:8080
  ```
  - Build the full controller stack including CUPS:
    
    `make build`
  - Start the full controller stack and CUPS UI:
    
    `make all-up`
    
    `make cups-ui-up`
  - Check whether controller CUPS UI already bring up by: 
    
    ```
    Docker ps 
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND                  CREATED     STATUS      PORTS

    ```
- OAMAgent(EPC-OAM as called) and EPC Control plane installation, configuration and run as `root`.
  - OAMAgent plays as epc agent between OpenNESS controller and EPC. It will process CUPS API message (HTTP based) from controller, parse JSON payload in the HTTP request, and then convert it to message format that can be used by EPC. The reverse as similar. The architecture and more details can refer to README in epc-oam repo.
  - OAMAgent Installation and configuration can refer to README in epc-oam repo.
  - EPC installation and configuration.

### First access for CUPS UI

Prerequisites:

- REACT_APP_CUPS_API=http://<<oamagent_ip_address>>:8080 added to Controller's "~/controller/.env" file.
- Controller full stack including CUPS UI are running.
- Oamagent and EPC are running.
- Confirm connection between controller and oamagent (EPC). 

Steps for the access:

- Open internet browser.
- Type in "http://<Controller_ip_address>:3010/userplanes" in address bar.
- Thus display all the existing EPC user planes list as below example:
  
  ![FirstAccess screen](cups-howto-images/first_access.png)

### Display specific user planes information and update it

- After type in "http://<Controller_ip_address>:3010/userplanes", find the user plane from the list.

- Click on "EDIT" button as below:
  
  ![Edit screen](cups-howto-images/edit.png)

- The user plane information is displayed as example below:
  
  ![Userplane5 screen](cups-howto-images/userplane5.png)

- Update parameters: S1-U , S5-U(SGW), S5-U(PGW), MNC,MCC, TAC and APN. And click on âSaveâ and pop up with âsuccessfully update userplaneâ as below: 
  
  ![Userplane5Update screen](cups-howto-images/userplane5_update.png)

- Then web page will automatically return back to the updated user plane list as below:
  
  ![Userplane5UpdateList screen](cups-howto-images/userplane5_update_thenlist.png)

### Create a new user plane

- Click on âCREATEâ button.

- Filling uuid with 36 char string , select Function as âSAEGWUâ and set values for parmaters: S1-U , S5-U(SGW), S5-U(PGW), MNC,MCC, TAC and APN. And click on âSaveâ and pop up with âsuccessfully created userplaneâ as below: 
  
  ![UserplaneCreate screen](cups-howto-images/userplane_create.png)

- Then web page will automatically return back to the updated user plane list as below:
  
  ![UserplaneCreateList screen](cups-howto-images/userplane_create_thenlist.png)

### Delete a user plane

- Find the user plane to delete and click on âEDITâ 

- Then web page will list the user plane information, and click on âDELETE USERPLANEâ with popup message with âsuccessfully delete userplaneâ as below:
  
  ![UserplaneDelete screen](cups-howto-images/userplane_delete.png)

- Then web page will automatically return back to the updated user plane list as below:
  
  ![UserplaneDeleteList screen](cups-howto-images/userplane_delete_thenlist.png)
 
## Troubleshooting
- Controller UI:
  - If you encounter HTTP errors like `500`,`400` and `404` please run `docker-compose logs -f ` from the `<controller>` or `<edge node>` source root directory.  This command will generate the log which can be used for further analysis.
  - Additionally, check log files listed below for more details
- Edge node:
  - Enrolment is unsuccesful: One of the things to check is if there are duplicate entries for the edge node. You can check by running `docker logs <cce_container_id>`, and see whether there is similar error print:
    ```
    cce[1]: [pkg=grpc] Failed to store Node credentials: error inserting record: Error 1062: Duplicate entry 'ef54af02-351d-4b3d-a758-559e395f1bc5' for key 'id'
    ```
    if it exists, delete the duplicate entry edge node on the controller and re-run edge node enrolment.
- CUPS UI:
  - If you encounter GET userplanes list failure with Error: "Network Error",  please check oamagent nginx configuration whether enable CORS configuration. README in the epc-oam folder gives a reference nginx configuration.
    - Another possibility is SELinux. Use commmand `getenforce` on the server where oamagent is running. If not zero, can use command `setenforce=0`.
    - Additionally, check log files listed below for more details.
  - If EDIT userplane failure with Error: "Request failed with status code 404"
    - Need to check oamagent log that contains more details about the failure, for example:
      
      ```

      Func:execute(Line:444)UserplanesGet For (3) Failed (404 Userplane not found).
      ```
### Log files 
Below are list of log files on Edge Node and controller. They can highlight any issues on the system. Log files can be accessed either looking info file on physical server (files stored in /var/log/ folder) or by running `docker-compose` or `docker logs` command in terminal with required parameters.
- Controller and Controller UI
  - `/var/log/messages` - general Operating system log file, but also contains logs from Controller UI component. 
  - `docker compose logs -f` - ran from `<controller>` source root directory. Use this file to check for errors related to UI (like HTTP errors `400`, `500` or `404`). Add `-t` parameter to follow the log output
- EdgeNode
  - `/var/log/messages` - general Operating system log file. Contains general information about server issues 
  - `docker-compose logs -f` - ran from `<edgenode>` source root directory. Contains information on virtual containers running.
  - `docker logs -f nts` - as above, but for nts component
  - `/var/log/appliance/messages` - appliance log file
  - folder `<edge_node_source>`/scripts/ansible/logs/ - contains logs from from build and deploy steps of EdgeNode
- EPC-OAM
  - `/var/log/messages` - Contains EPC-OAM(OAMAgent) debug information.
  - Tcpdump can capture HTTP message between Controller CUPS and OAMAgent. 
    - The exmaple is as below:
      
      ```
      tcpdump âi eth1 âw test.pcap. 
      (NOTE: eth1 assumed to be Ethernet Interface used by OAMAgent) 
      ```
    - Then can use wireshark to open it and check HTTP request/response and JSON body content as below:
      
      ![WiresharkExample screen](cups-howto-images/wireshark_example.png)
