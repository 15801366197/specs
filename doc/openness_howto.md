## Introduction
The aim of this guide is to familiarize the user with OpenNESS controller's User Interface. This "How to" guide will provide instructions on how to create a sample configuration via UI.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. Controller and Edge node installation and configuration is assumed to be run as `root`. 
2. Controller Web UI only supports only one user and its `admin` user.   
3. As part of the Application deployment a HTTPs based Application Image download server is required. 
    - An example is provided in the "Creating HTTPS server for image download" section to deploy HTTPs image server on Controller.    
   
  ![HTTPs Image Server setup](howto-images/openness_apponboard.png)

#### Creating HTTPS server for image download
##### Instructions to setup HTTP server 
Prerequisites:
- Controller should be up and running in order to access root CA. 

- Install apache and mod_ssl     
`yum install -y httpd mod_ssl`    
- Go into /etc/ssl/certs    
 `cd /etc/ssl/certs`    
- Acquire the controller root ca and key
```
docker cp edgecontroller_cce_1:/artifacts/certificates/ca/cert.pem . 
docker cp edgecontroller_cce_1:/artifacts/certificates/ca/key.pem .
``` 
- Generate the apache key and crt
```
openssl genrsa -out apache.key 2048
openssl req -new -sha256 -key apache.key -subj "/C=IE/ST=Clare/O=ESIE/CN=$(hostname -f)" -out apache.csr
openssl x509 -req -in apache.csr -CA cert.pem -CAkey key.pem -CAcreateserial -out apache.crt -days 500 -sha256
```
- Edit apache config and point it to the new certs
```
sed -i 's|^SSLCertificateFile.*$|SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/apache.crt|g' /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
sed -i 's|^SSLCertificateKeyFile.*$|SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/certs/apache.key|g' /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```
- Set the firewall to accept the traffic
```
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
firewall-cmd --reload    
``` 
- Enable and restart apache after the changes
```
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl restart httpd
```

##### Instruction to upload and access images
> Note: Refer to "Docker Images Creation" in the "OpenVINO Sample Application in OpenNESS - README.md file" under <edge_node>/build/openvino. 

- Put the images into /var/www/html    
`cp test_image.tar.gz /var/www/html/`    
`chmod a+r /var/www/html/*tar.gz`    
- Construct the URL (Source in Controller UI) as:    
`https://<controller_hostname>/test_image.tar.gz`

>Note: Controller host name to be used for the URL can be acquired by running ```hostname -f``` in the controller node shell. 

### First login
In order to access the UI the user needs to provide credentials during login.

Prerequisites:
- An internet browser to access the login page.
- REACT_APP_CONTROLLER_API='http://<Controller_IP_address>:8080' added to Controller's "~/edgecontroller/ui/controller/.env" file.
- If working behind proxy or firewall appropriate ports open.
- Controller set up (including the UI application) and running.

The following steps need to be done for successful login:
- Open internet browser.
- Type in http://<Controller_ip_address>:3000/login in address bar.
- Enter you username and password (default username: admin) (the password to be used is the password provided during Controller bring-up with the CCE_ADMIN_PASSWORD in "~/edgecontroller/ui/controller/.env").
- Click on "SIGN IN" button.

![Login screen](howto-images/login.png)

### Enrollment

In order for the Controller and Edge Node to work together the Edge Node needs to enroll with the Controller. The Edge Node will continuously try to connect to the controller until its serial key is recognized by the Controller.

Prerequisites:
- Controller's IP address must be provided in Edge Node's "scripts/ansible/deploy_server/vars/defaults.yml" file. This IP needs to be added/edited in the file in following format: enrollment_endpoint: "<Controller_IP_address>:8081"
- Controller's ROOT CA  needs to be added to "/etc/pki/tls/certs/controller-root-ca.pem" on Edge Node. The certificate can be aquired by running `docker cp edgecontroller_cce_1:/artifacts/certificates/ca/cert.pem . `.
- The Edge Node's deployment script has been started ('./03_build_and_deploy.sh' script on Edge Node is printing out "Waiting for certificates").
- Upon Edge Node's deployment a Serial Key has been printed out to the terminal and retrieved to be used during enrollment.
- User has logged in to UI.

In order to enroll and add new Edge Node to be managed by the Controller the following steps are to be taken:
- Navigate to 'NODES' tab.
- Click on 'ADD EDGE NODE' button.

![Add Edge Node 1](howto-images/Enroll1.png)

- Enter previously obtained Edge Node Serial Key into 'Serial*' field.
- Enter the name and location of Edge Node.
- Press 'ADD EDGE NODE'.

![Add Edge Node 2](howto-images/Enroll2.png)

![DNS](howto-images/DNS.png)

 ### 7 OpenVINO Manual Configuration steps

The following manual steps need to be done to fully configure the OpenVino pipeline on the EdgeNode. These steps need to be run from terminal on the EdgeNode.

Run 'docker ps' to find running containers on EdgeNode.
OpenVino consumer container can be distinguished by "./start.sh" text in its 'COMMAND' field under 'docker ps'.

Configure DNS container's KNI interface:
 
```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> ip link set dev vEth0 arp off
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> ip a a 53.53.53.53/24 dev vEth0
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> ip link set dev vEth0 up
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> ip route add 192.168.200.0/24 dev vEth0
```

Make a request on the DNS interface subnet to register the KNI interface with NTS client (press CTRL + C buttons as soon as a request is made (no expectation for hostname to resolve)):

```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_mec-app-edgednssvr> wget 192.168.200.123 -Y off
```

Configure OpenVino Consumer container's KNI interface:
Find the name of KNI interface inside the container (interface name vEthX):
```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  ip addr
```
Using the found interface name run following:

```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  ip link set dev vEth2 arp off
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  ip a a 192.168.200.20/24 dev vEth2
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  ip link set dev vEth2 up
```

Make a request on the OpenVino Consumer interface subnet to register the KNI interface with NTS client (press CTRL + C buttons as soon as a request is made (no expectation for hostname to resolve)):
```
docker exec -it <Container_ID_of_openVino-consumer-app>  wget 192.168.200.123 -Y off
```

### 8 OpenVINO Downstream setup 

This is a sample setup for Downstream setup (EPC/IP Downstream). This is downstream node in this example will behave like Application connected to the PDN gateway or IP gateway. For the purpose of testing OpenVINO App in the IP domain. You need to connect a server and assign an IP to an interface connected to the Edge Node Downstream. The IP assigned IP address must be as follows - 192.168.200.2. 

> Note: Do not Ping/send traffic from downstream to the Application on the edge node. This is because ping/sending traffic will add a learning entry into the NTS dataplane. If this is done by mistake then NTS Dataplane has to be restarted and the Traffic policy needs to be re-configured. 

### 9 OpenVINO Client Simulator Setup

The following prerequisites must be installed on the platform where the client
simulator will be set up:

* Docker
* OS with graphical support
* VNC server or a physically attached monitor

1. Update `/etc/hosts` file with a record for `openvino.openness` hostname

    ```shell
    echo "192.168.200.20 openvino.openness" >> /etc/hosts
    ```

2. Set the IP address of the ethernet interface which is connected to the
OpenNESS Edge Node with an IP address in the same subnet as for
`openvino.openness` hostname

    ```shell
    ifconfig enp1s0f0 192.168.200.10 up
    ```

3. In order for the NTS Dataplane to have learnt both upstream and downstream traffic flow we need to send traffic (Ping/iperf) from Upstream IP to the downstream server.    
  
   ```shell
    ping 192.168.200.2
   ```

3. Update ARP tables for the configured interface

    ```shell
    arp -s openvino.openness deadbeef
    ```

4. Build the `client-sim` docker image that as described in
   **OpenVINO Sample Application in OpenNESS** section
   **Build & Deployment of OpenVINO Applications**.

5. From a VNC window or on the attached monitor, run the docker image using
   the provided script to get the traffic flowing and visualized:

    ```shell
    cd <appliance-ce-directory>/build/openvino/clientsim
    ./run-docker.sh
    ```
