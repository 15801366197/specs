### Enrollment

In order for the Controller and Edge Node to work together the Edge Node needs to enroll with the Controller. The Edge Node will continuously try to connect to the controller until its serial key is recognized by the Controller.

Prerequisites:
- Controller's IP address must be provided in Edge Node's "scripts/ansible/deploy_server/vars/defaults.yml" file. This IP needs to be added/edited in the file in following format: enrollment_endpoint: "<Controller_IP_address>:8081"
- Controller's ROOT CA  needs to be added to "/etc/pki/tls/certs/controller-root-ca.pem" on Edge Node. The Controller's ROOT CA is printed out to the terminal during Controller bring up.
- The Edge Node's deployment script has been started.
- Upon Edge Node's deployment a Serial Key has been printed out to the terminal and retrieved to be used during enrollment.
- User has logged in to UI.

In order to enroll and add new Edge Node to be managed by the Controller the following steps are to be taken:
- Navigate to 'NODES' tab.
- Click on 'ADD EDGE NODE' button.

![Add Edge Node 1](howto-images/Enroll1.png)

- Enter previously obtained Edge Node Serial Key into 'Serial*' field.
- Enter the name and location of Edge Node.
- Press 'ADD EDGE NODE'.

![Add Edge Node 2](howto-images/Enroll2.png)

- Check that your Edge Node is visible under 'List of Edge Nodes' (Also at this stage the Ansible script for bringing up Edge Node should successfully finish executing).

  - Priority: 99
  - Source -> IP Filter -> IP Address: 1.1.1.1
  - Source -> IP Filter -> Mask: 24
  - Source -> IP Filter -> Begin Port: 10
  - Source -> IP Filter -> End Port: 20
  - Source -> IP Filter -> Protocol: all
  - Target -> Description: "Sample Description"
  - Target -> Action: accept
- Click on "CREATE".

After creating Traffic Policy it will be visible under 'List of Traffic Policies' in 'TRAFFIC POLICIES' tab.

![Creating Traffic Policy 3](howto-images/CreatingTrafficPolicy3.png)

#### Adding Traffic Policy to Interface
Prerequisites:
- Enrollment phase completed successfully.
- User is logged in to UI.
- Traffic Policy Created.

To add a previously created traffic policy to an interface available on Edge Node the following steps need to be completed:
- From UI navigate to "NODES" tab.
- Find Edge Node on the 'List Of Edge Nodes'.
- Click "EDIT".

![Adding Traffic Policy To Interface 1](howto-images/AddingTrafficPolicyToInterface1.png)

- Navigate to "INTERFACES" tab.
- Find desired interface which will be used to add traffic policy.
- Click 'ADD' under 'Traffic Policy' column for that interface.
- A window titled 'Assign Traffic Policy to interface' will pop-up. Select a previously created traffic policy.
- Click on 'ASSIGN'.

![Adding Traffic Policy To Interface 2](howto-images/AddingTrafficPolicyToInterface2.png)

On success the user is able to see 'EDIT' and 'REMOVE POLICY' buttons under 'Traffic Policy' column for desired interface. These buttons can be respectively used for editing and removing traffic rule policy on that interface.

#### Configuring Interface
Prerequisites:
- Enrollment phase completed successfully.
- User is logged in to UI.

In order to configure interface available on the Edge Node for the NTS the following steps are to be taken:
- From UI navigate to 'INTERFACES' tab of the Edge Node.
- Find the interface to be used in the interface list and click 'EDIT' button under 'Action' column for that interface.

![Configuring Interface 1](howto-images/AddingInterfaceToNTS.png)

- A window will pop-up titled "Edit Interface". The following fields need to be set:
  - Driver: userspace
  - Type: upstream
  - Fall-back Interface: PCI address of another available interface ie. '0000:3d:00.1'
- Click 'SAVE'.

![Configuring Interface 2](howto-images/AddingInterfaceToNTS1.png)

Prerequisite:
- Enrollment phase completed successfully.
- User is logged in to UI.
- User has access to a HTTPS server providing a downloadable copy of Docker container image or VM image.
- A saved copy of Docker image or VM image in a location accessible by above HTTPS server.

To add an application to list of applications managed by Controller following steps need to be taken:

- From UI navigate to 'APPLICATIONS' tab.
- Click on 'ADD APPLICATION' button.

![Creating Application 1](howto-images/CreatingApplication1.png)

- After 'Add an Application' window pops up add details as per following example:
  - Name: SampleApp
  - Type: Container
  - Version: 1
  - Vendor: vendor
  - Description: description
  - Cores: 2
  - Memory: 100
  - Source: https://<IP_address_of_https_server_storing_the_image>/image_file_name
- Then memory unit used is MB. A sample path to image could be https://192.10.10.10/sample_docker_app.tar.gz.
- Click 'UPLOAD APPLICATION'

![Creating Application 2](howto-images/CreatingApplication2.png)

- The appliaction will be displayed in Controller's 'List of Applications'.

![Creating Application 3](howto-images/CreatingApplication3.png)


### Deploying Applications
Prerequisite:
- Enrollment phase completed successfully.
- User is logged in to UI.
- Application is added to Controller's application list.
- NTS is configured and started.

To deploy an application on a specific node the following steps are required:

- Navigate to 'NODES' tab and find the node application is destined to.
- Click on 'EDIT'.

![Deploying Application 1](howto-images/DeployingApp1.png)

- From within the nodes tabs navigate to 'APPS' tab.
- Click 'DEPLOY APP'.

![Deploying Application 2](howto-images/DeployingApp2.png)

- Under 'Choose an application to deploy' field, choose the application to be deployed from the drop down menu.
- Click 'DEPLOY'

_NOTE: Depending on the size of the application image the timeout used for HTTPS request download might be exceeded, image not downloaded, and application not deployed. In case where large image is to be used, requiring longer download time the following can be changed to overcome this issue (to be done before building Edge Controller).

- Edit controller-ce/ui/controller/src/api/ApiClient.js:9 on the controller.
- Change timeout value: "timeout: <desired_timeout_in_mS >"_

![Deploying Application 3](howto-images/DeployingApp3.png)

- The application will be created on the Edge Node and added to application list for that node under 'APPS' tab, its status will be 'deployed'.

![Deploying Application 4](howto-images/DeployingApp4.png)

- To start the application on the Edge Node click 'START'.
- Application will start, its 'status' will change to running (browser refresh might be needed).
