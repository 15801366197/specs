##Introduction
OpenNESS is an open source software toolkit to enable easy orchestration and management of edge services across diverse network platform and access technologies in multi-cloud environments. It is inspired by the edge computing architecture defined by the ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing standards (e.g., [ETSI_MEC 003]), as well as the 5G network architecture ([3GPP_23501]).
 
## Overview
An OpenNESS subsystem consists of one or more OpenNESS Edge Nodes, and an OpenNESS Controller. 
The Edge Node hosts 
- Edge compute applications, 
- OpenNESS Edge Node Microservices that 
  - Manage applications across their lifecycles 
  - Steer dataplane traffic to Edge node applications 
  - Steering dataplane Traffic to local breakout (LBO) hosts that may be attached to the Edge Node.
