## Run Greengrass on OpenNESS

This section describe how to setup and run AWS Greengrass on openNESS in a Docker container.

### Running AWS IoT Greengrass in a Docker Container

#### Download Dockerfile from AWS

AWS provides a Dockerfile and Docker image that make it easier for you to run AWS IoT Greengrass in a Docker container.
In order to get it go to AWS IoT Greengrass Developer Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide>. In Downloads section of "What is AWS IoT Greengrass" <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/what-is-gg.html#gg-docker-download> find Docker package. Download it and unzip it on your machine.

#### AWS IoT Greengrass

Go to "Configure AWS IoT Greengrass on AWS IoT" section of AWS IoT Greengrass Developer Guide (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/greengrass/latest/developerguide/gg-config.html>) and follow it until you download and store your Core's security resources as a tar.gz.

Unzip its content into the same directory where the Dockerfile is.

#### Modify Dockerfile and docker-compose file

You have to modify the ```Dockerfile``` and ```docker-compose.yml``` file before taking next steps.

Add the following section in the Dockerfile:

```docker
# Copy certs files
COPY "./certs/*" /greengrass/certs/
COPY "./config/*" /greengrass/config/
RUN chmod 444 /greengrass/config/config.json
```

In ```docker-compose.yml``` file comment out ```volumes``` section with ```#``` sign:

```docker
#    volumes:
#      - ./certs:/greengrass/certs
#      - ./config:/greengrass/config
#      - ./deployment:/greengrass/ggc/deployment
#      - ./log:/greengrass/ggc/var/log
```

#### Build a docker container image with credentials

Go to the folder with Dockerfile and run the following command:

```docker-compose up --build -d```

Now you have to commit changes to the image:

```docker commit aws-iot-greengrass aws-iot-greengrass```

Then save the modified container image into the file:

```docker save aws-iot-greengrass > aws-iot-greengrass.tar.gz```

Now you can deploy ```aws-iot-greengrass.tar.gz``` file in OpenNESS according to controller User Guide.

### Greengrass Deployment on AWS IoT

After Greengrass container is run by the OpenNESS Controller, follow the Greengrass setup and deployment steps in AWS IoT Greengrass Developer Guide.
